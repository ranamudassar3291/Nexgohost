# Nexgohost - Hosting & Client Management Platform

## Recent Changes (Session 11)
- **Affiliate Withdrawal System**: New `affiliateWithdrawalsTable` added to DB schema and pushed. Client can request withdrawals from approved commission balance via `POST /api/affiliate/withdraw`. Validation: requires PayPal email saved, sufficient approved balance. Client can view withdrawal history via `GET /api/affiliate/withdrawals`.
- **Admin Withdrawal Management**: New admin routes — `GET /api/admin/affiliates/withdrawals/all`, `PUT /admin/affiliates/withdrawals/:id/approve`, `/pay`, `/reject`. Admin Affiliates page now has 3 tabs: Affiliates | Commissions | Withdrawals (with pending count badge). Approve → Mark Paid → Reject actions per row.
- **Auto-commission on checkout**: When a referred user (tracked via `affiliateReferralsTable`) completes a hosting order, a commission is automatically created in `affiliateCommissionsTable` (percentage or fixed per affiliate settings). Affiliate's `totalEarnings` and `pendingEarnings` incremented. Referral status updated to `converted`. All non-blocking (fire-and-forget).
- **Domain transfer confirmation email**: `POST /api/domains/transfer` now sends a branded HTML email to the client with domain name, price, status, and step-by-step next-steps instructions. Non-blocking.
- **Client Affiliate page updated**: Shows "Withdrawable Balance" stat, new withdrawal request form, and full withdrawal history table with status, PayPal, admin notes columns.

## Recent Changes (Session 10)
- **DB schema**: Added `orderId` (nullable text) column to `hostingServicesTable` — pushed to DB. Creates a 1-to-1 link between each hosting service and the order that created it.
- **checkout.ts**: Service creation now stores `orderId: order.id` so each service is uniquely linked to its originating order.
- **orders.ts — findServiceForOrder()**: Replaced ambiguous `planId`/`domain` matching with `orderId`-first lookup. Fallback for legacy records (no `orderId`) uses exact domain match scoped to that client only.
- **orders.ts — activate endpoint**: Replaced planId/domain-based service reuse with `orderId` lookup. Always creates a brand-new service (with `orderId`) if none found — guarantees each order gets its own unique cPanel account.
- **hosting.ts — getRenewalAmount()**: New helper. Priority: `renewalPrice` (if set on plan) → cycle-specific price (yearly/quarterly/semiannual) → base monthly price. Fixes bug where `yearlyPrice` was overriding `renewalPrice` when billing cycle was yearly.
- **hosting.ts — getOrderAmount()**: New helper for plan changes/upgrades — uses cycle-specific prices only (no `renewalPrice`), correct for new purchase invoices.
- **hosting.ts — renew endpoint**: Uses `getRenewalAmount` — now always shows the correct renewal price in PKR.
- **hosting.ts — upgrade endpoint**: Uses `getOrderAmount` — correct price for plan change invoices.

## Recent Changes (Session 9)
- **Ticket sender name fix**: Client `TicketDetail.tsx` — updated `Message` interface from `sender: string` to `senderName + senderRole`. Removed hardcoded "You" label; messages now display the actual sender's name (client's real name or admin name). `isStaff` check updated to use `senderRole`.
- **Cart system (Hostinger-style)**: Added `CartContext.tsx` (localStorage-persisted cart). Created `/client/cart` page (Cart.tsx) showing items, billing cycle selector, order summary, and "Proceed to Checkout" button. Updated `NewOrder.tsx` — "Order Now" button replaced with "Add to Cart" (adds to cart → redirects to cart). Cart icon with badge count added to both desktop header and mobile header (client only). Route `/client/cart` added to App.tsx. `CartProvider` wraps the entire app.
- **Email templates upgraded to HTML**: All plain-text default email templates (invoice-created, invoice-paid, order-created, hosting-created, password-reset, ticket-reply, service-suspended, service-cancelled) replaced with professional branded HTML templates. Seeder updated to auto-upgrade existing plain-text templates to HTML on server restart.

## Recent Changes (Session 8)
- **EditPackage.tsx**: Added `renewalPrice` UI field (visible when "Enable Renewal" is toggled on). Admin can now set a custom renewal price per plan.
- **API: cPanel Password Change**: `POST /admin/hosting/:id/change-password` and `POST /client/hosting/:id/change-password` — updates DB and attempts live WHM password change via new `cpanelChangePassword()` in `cpanel.ts`.
- **API: WordPress Installer**: `POST /admin/hosting/:id/install-wordpress` and `POST /client/hosting/:id/install-wordpress` — generates secure WordPress admin credentials, returns login URL. Server-side install requires Softaculous/Installatron.
- **Client ServiceDetail page** (`/client/hosting/:id`): New page showing service overview, resource usage bars, quick access buttons (cPanel SSO, Webmail SSO, Change Password, Install WordPress), inline password change panel, WordPress installer form with credential output, and service action buttons.
- **Client Hosting.tsx**: Added "Manage Service" button to each service card linking to `/client/hosting/:id`.
- **Admin Hosting.tsx**: Added "Password" button per service row; clicking opens a modal to set a new cPanel password (with show/hide toggle).
- **NewOrder.tsx**: Passes `renewalPrice` URL param to checkout when plan has renewal configured.
- **Checkout.tsx**: Reads `renewalPrice` from URL params and displays it in the order summary section.

## Recent Changes (Session 7)
- **PKR currency on AddOrder/AddInvoice/ClientDetail/Hosting**: `formatPrice` applied to all price displays.
- **Checkout: Free domain TLD modal**: Shows TLD selection popup when registering a domain with free domain enabled. Domain inserted to `domainsTable` with "pending" status on checkout.
- **InvoiceDetail.tsx**: Dynamically fetches active payment methods from DB (instead of 3 hardcoded). Falls back to billing email.
- **`renewalPrice` field**: Added to `hostingPlansTable` schema + DB pushed. `packages.ts` API handles it in formatPlan/POST/PUT. `AddPackage.tsx` has form field + submit. `EditPackage.tsx` has form state + submit payload + UI field.
- **TLD Management in admin nav**: `AppLayout.tsx` shows "TLD Management" in Management nav group linking to `/admin/domains/extensions`.

## Recent Changes (Session 6)
- **White/Light Theme**: Complete CSS overhaul in `index.css` — switched from dark navy to clean white/light SaaS theme. Background is off-white (`0 0% 98%`), cards are pure white, primary remains purple (`263 70% 50%`), sidebar is white. `glass-card` utility updated for light mode with box shadows. Grid pattern updated to subtle purple tint.
- **Billing Cycles (Quarterly + Semiannual)**: Added `quarterly_price` and `semiannual_price` columns to `hosting_plans` DB table via SQL migration. Updated Drizzle schema (`lib/db/src/schema/hosting.ts`). Updated `packages.ts` API to include both new fields in `formatPlan()`, and in create/update endpoints using raw SQL for the new columns.
- **Admin AddPackage + EditPackage**: Added quarterly and semiannual price input fields to both admin package forms. Updated billing cycle dropdown to include "Quarterly" and "Semiannual" options. Submit handlers now send all 4 price tiers.
- **Client NewOrder (billing cycle selector)**: `NewOrder.tsx` now shows per-plan billing cycle selector buttons (Monthly/Quarterly/Semiannual/Yearly). Price displayed dynamically based on selected cycle. Checkout receives the correct price + cycle. Only available cycles are shown (based on which prices are configured).
- **Client Hosting Renewal**: Added "Renew Service" button to each hosting service card. Clicking opens a renewal confirmation modal. On confirm, calls `POST /api/client/hosting/:id/renew` which creates an invoice for the appropriate billing cycle. Success state shows invoice number with a "View & Pay Invoice" button.
- **Renewal API**: New `POST /api/client/hosting/:id/renew` endpoint in `hosting.ts` — looks up service + plan, determines amount based on billing cycle, creates invoice with 7-day due date.

## Recent Changes (Session 5)
- **PKR currency formatting**: `CurrencyProvider.tsx` now formats all amounts as `Rs. 1,000.00` (with commas, period after Rs) using `toLocaleString("en-US")`. Other currencies use their symbol with same locale formatting.
- **Homepage pricing**: Public homepage now imports `useCurrency` and renders all plan prices via `formatPrice(plan.price)` — respects the selected currency and exchange rate.
- **Real revenue chart**: `GET /api/admin/dashboard` now computes `revenueByDay` — a 30-day series of actual paid invoice revenue (grouped by date, gaps filled with 0). Admin dashboard replaced `mockChartData` with this real data.
- **Admin dashboard upgraded**: New `newClientsMonth` stat; real AreaChart with currency-formatted tooltip/axis; "Recent Signups" sidebar panel; improved stat cards with trend subtitles; bottom quick-stats row.
- **Admin sidebar grouped navigation**: AppLayout sidebar now organizes 25+ admin nav items into 7 collapsible groups (Overview, Management, Support, Commerce, Infrastructure, Analytics & Logs, System) with animated expand/collapse.
- **Currency across all pages**: Replaced all hardcoded `$X.XX` with `formatPrice()` from `useCurrency` hook in: Admin Invoices, Admin Reports, Client Invoices, Client Dashboard.
- **Admin Invoices enhanced**: Better stat cards with icons; invoice count badges on filter tabs; overdue count display; improved empty state.
- **Admin Reports rebuilt**: Now uses real data from `/api/admin/dashboard` (not a mock structure); shows `totalRevenue`, `monthlyRevenue`, and `recentOrders` with proper currency formatting.

## Recent Changes (Session 4)
- **Logout fix**: `queryClient.clear()` is now called on logout to immediately purge all cached auth data
- **Admin Orders: Activate button**: `POST /admin/orders/:id/activate` provisions the hosting service, creates a service record if missing, marks invoice paid, updates order to approved+paid — shows modal with cPanel/Webmail credentials
- **Admin Orders: Quick Access column**: cPanel (orange) and Webmail (blue) quick-login links appear inline for approved hosting orders with active services
- **Client Dashboard: Active Services section**: Shows active hosting services with cPanel and Webmail quick-access buttons (fetched from `/api/client/hosting`)
- **Checkout Step 2: RDAP domain availability**: Typing a domain auto-triggers availability check (800ms debounce) via `/api/domains/availability`; shows green "available" or red "already registered" status; also has manual search button
- **queryClient extracted**: Moved to `artifacts/nexgohost/src/lib/query-client.ts` so AuthProvider can call `queryClient.clear()` on logout

- **API framework**: Express 5 (running on port 8080)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS v4 (dark purple SaaS theme)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: JWT (jsonwebtoken + bcryptjs), token stored in localStorage
- **API codegen**: Orval (from OpenAPI spec → React Query hooks + Zod schemas)

## Demo Credentials

- **Admin**: `admin@nexgohost.com` / `admin123`

## Domain Ordering System

The client portal has a full domain ordering workflow:
- **Real availability checking** via RDAP (Registration Data Access Protocol) — no API key required. RDAP servers queried per TLD: Verisign (.com/.net), PublicInterestRegistry (.org), etc.
- **Cart** — clients add multiple TLDs to cart, select 1–3 year registration periods
- **Checkout** — creates domain record (status: active), order (status: approved), and invoice (status: unpaid) atomically
- **Dashboard sync** — domain count updates immediately after registration
- **API hooks**: `useSearchDomainAvailability`, `useRegisterDomain` in `lib/api-client-react/src/domain-order.ts`

## Database Schema

Tables: `users`, `hosting_plans`, `hosting_services`, `domains`, `domain_pricing`, `orders`, `invoices`, `transactions`, `tickets`, `ticket_messages`, `migrations_requests`, `promo_codes`, `payment_methods`, `domain_extensions`, `currencies`, `servers`, `product_groups`, `email_templates`

**hosting_plans module fields**: `module` (none/cpanel/20i/directadmin/plesk), `moduleServerId` (specific server), `moduleServerGroupId` (group-based server selection — provision picks any active server in the group), `modulePlanId`, `modulePlanName`

**hosting_services extended fields**: `password`, `serverId`, `billingCycle`, `nextDueDate`, `sslStatus`, `webmailUrl`, `cancelRequested`, `cancelReason`, `cancelRequestedAt`

**Order statuses**: pending, approved, completed, cancelled, suspended, fraud, terminated
**Invoice statuses**: unpaid, paid, cancelled, overdue, refunded, collections

## Key Technical Notes

- **Auth token injection**: `lib/api-client-react/src/custom-fetch.ts` automatically reads JWT from localStorage and adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to all requests
- **Auth context split**: `AuthProvider` lives in `artifacts/nexgohost/src/context/AuthProvider.tsx`; `useAuth` hook in `artifacts/nexgohost/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx` — split to prevent Vite HMR incompatibility
- **Vite proxy**: `/api` requests from the frontend are proxied to `http://localhost:8080` during development
- **Route protection**: `AdminPage`/`ClientPage` inline guards in `App.tsx` — each route independently guards without wildcard Switch nesting (Wouter v3 strips prefix in nested Switches with wildcards)
- **Flat route tree**: All admin and client routes live in a single flat `<Switch>` to avoid Wouter v3 nested routing context bugs. No `<Route path="/admin/:rest*">` wildcards
- **Invoice numbers**: Auto-generated as `INV-YYYYMMDD-XXXXXX` in `checkout.ts`
- **Promo code validation**: `GET /api/promo-codes/validate?code=X&amount=Y` — checks active/limit/expiry, returns discount breakdown. Checkout atomically increments `usedCount`
- **JWT secret**: Stored in `JWT_SECRET` environment variable (defaults to a hardcoded dev value if not set)

## Google OAuth (Server-Side Flow)

- **Admin config page**: `/admin/settings/google` — Client ID, Client Secret (masked), Allowed Domains, Redirect URI copy button
- **Flow**: Server-side auth code flow (NOT implicit). `GET /api/auth/google/start` → Google → `GET /api/auth/google/callback` → `/google-callback?token=JWT`
- **Callback page**: `/google-callback` — reads token from URL, calls `login()`, redirects to dashboard
- **Settings stored**: `google_client_id`, `google_client_secret`, `google_allowed_domains` in `settings` table
- **Button shown**: Only when BOTH clientId AND clientSecret are configured (`configured: true` from `/api/auth/google/config`)
- **Allowed domains**: Optional comma-separated list; if set, only those email domains may sign in via Google
- **Logging**: All OAuth attempts (start, callback, success, error, blocked) logged to `admin_logs`
- **Error handling**: OAuth errors redirect to `/client/login?error=<code>` with user-friendly messages shown inline
